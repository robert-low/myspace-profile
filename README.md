# myspace-profile

An <strong>old</strong> repo, publicly pushed for the purposes of my Teaching Assistant role where I was introducing GitHub pages to students.
It displays some of my very earliest attempts (and not my proudest moments) at HTML and CSS by building a landing page which was supposed to mimic... MySpace.
<br><br>
This was a space to be creative, with no best practices displayed here.

You can visit https://robert-low.github.io/profile/ if you're curious, or you can ignore the code and look down.
